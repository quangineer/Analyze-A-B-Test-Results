# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results
This project is dedicated to Udacity. It is conducted to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  The ultimate goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
